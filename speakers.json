    "description": " If no one downloads or uses your npm module, you might need better documentation. Your README.md is the first access point for your code: I'll talk about how to use the standard-readme specification to make sure your readmes are high quality, and how the spec is already being used by hundreds of repositories to stop bike-shedding and save time. I'll demo a standard-readme generator and a linter, to help you write your readme. Ideally, you should be able to walk away knowing that writing docs is easier than you think."
