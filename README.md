# jsconf2017-special

Date: May 4th, 2017
Time: 7pm
Location: co.up, 3rd floor.
Meetup link: T.B.D.
After Meetup: T.B.D and to be coordinated with CSSConf.EU

Rough idea: We want to have a meetup where we bring people together who are in
town for JSConf.eu to mix and mingle with the BerlinJS community. Ideally we get
some talks from speakers / rejected speakers from their pool. Think of it as a
super mini, low-key Reject.JS
